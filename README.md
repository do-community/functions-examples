# Serverless Functions Examples

Here is a list of serverless functions that you can deploy to DigitalOcean Functions.

## How this repo works

- Each folder is its own serverless function.
- Each folder has its own **README.md**
- Each folder has a [Deploy to DigitalOcean](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/how-to/add-deploy-do-button/) button so you can 1-click deploy
